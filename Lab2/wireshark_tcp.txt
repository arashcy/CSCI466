Wireshark TCP Lab:

Answers for lab:

1. What is the IP address and TCP port number used by the client computer (source) that is transferring the file to gaia.cs.umass.edu? To answer this question, it’s probably easiest to select an HTTP message and explore the details of the TCP packet used to carry this HTTP message, using the “details of the selected packet header window”.
	IP address: 128.119.245.12
	TCP port number: 80

2. What is the IP address of gaia.cs.umass.edu? On what port number is it sending and receiving TCP segments for this connection?
	IP address: 192.168.1.102
	Port number: 1161

3. What is the IP address and TCP port number used by your client computer (source) to transfer the file to gaia.cs.umass.edu?
	IP address: 10.92.210.40
	TCP port number: 80

4. What is the sequence number of the TCP SYN segment that is used to initiate the TCP connection between the client computer and gaia.cs.umass.edu? What is it in the segment that identifies the segment as a SYN segment?
	Sequence number: 0
	It is identified as a SYN segment by the flag 0x002, which is the SYN flag.

5. What is the sequence number of the SYNACK segment sent by gaia.cs.umass.edu to the client computer in reply to the SYN? What is the value of the Acknowledgement field in the SYNACK segment? How did gaia.cs.umass.edu determine that value? What is it in the segment that identifies the segment as a SYNACK segment?
	Sequence number: 0
	Value of Acknowledgement field: 1
	gaia.cs.umass.edu determined that value because it is the acknowledgement of the very first SYN segment.
	It is identified as a SYNACK segment by the flag 0x012, which is the SYN, ACK flag.

6. What is the sequence number of the TCP segment containing the HTTP POST command?
	Sequence number: 1

7. Consider the TCP segment containing the HTTP POST as the first segment in the TCP connection. What are the sequence numbers of the first six segments in the TCP connection (including the segment containing the HTTP POST)? At what time was each segment sent? When was the ACK for each segment received? Given the difference between when each TCP segment was sent, and when its acknowledgement was received, what is the RTT value for each of the six segments? What is the EstimatedRTT value after the receipt of each ACK? Assume that the value of the EstimatedRTT is equal to the measured RTT for the first segment, and then is computed using the Estimated RTT  equation for all subsequent segments.
	Segment 1 
		Sequence number: 1
		Time sent: 0.026477
		Time ACK received: 0.053937
		RTT value: 0.027460000
	Segment 2 
		Sequence number: 566
		Time sent: 0.041737
		Time ACK received: 0.077294
		RTT value: 0.035557000
	Segment 3 
		Sequence number: 2026
		Time sent: 0.054026
		Time ACK received: 0.124085
		RTT value: 0.070059000
	Segment 4
		Sequence number: 3486
		Time sent: 0.054690
		Time ACK received: 0.169118
		RTT value: 0.114428000
	Segment 5
		Sequence number: 4946
		Time sent: 0.077405
		Time ACK received: 0.217299
		RTT value: 0.0139894000
	Segment 6
		Sequence number: 6406
		Time sent: 0.078157
		Time ACK received: 0.267802
		RTT value: 0.189645000

8. What is the length of each of the first six TCP segments?
	Segment 1 length: 565
	Segment 2 length: 1460
	Segment 3 length: 1460
	Segment 4 length: 1460
	Segment 5 length: 1460
	Segment 6 length: 1460

9. What is the minimum amount of available buffer space advertised at the received for the entire trace? Does the lack of receiver buffer space over throttle the sender?
	The minimum size of the receiver window, as found in the first acknowledgement from the server, is 5840.

10. Are there any retransmitted segments in the trace file? What did you check for (in the trace) in order to answer this question?

11. How much data does the receiver typically acknowledge in an ACK? Can you identify cases where the receiver is ACKing every other received segment?

12. What is the throughput (bytes transferred per unit time) for the TCP connection? Explain how you calculated this value.

13. Use the Time-Sequence-Graph(Stevens) plotting tool to view the sequence number versus time plot of segments being sent from the client to the gaia.cs.umass.edu server. Can you identify where TCP’s slowstart phase begins and ends, and where congestion avoidance takes over? Comment on ways in which the measured data differs from the idealized behavior of TCP that we’ve studied in the text.

14. Answer each of the two questions above for the trace that you have gathered when you transferred file from your computer to gaia.cs.umass.edu.
