3.)
a.) Replicate the example from the video and take a screenshot of wireshark showing a flow modification message.

//done, just add screenshot/s of flow mod message

b.) Show the flow table on switch s1. (Hint: Remember how from the walkthrough.) There separate entries for flows from h1 and from h4. Why is there not a single bi-directional flow table entry instead.


c.) After how long and under what conditions do the flow table entries at the switch expire?


d.) After the flow table entries have expired  run:
	Mininet> h1 ping -c5 h4
Why do the latencies tend to go down over time?
