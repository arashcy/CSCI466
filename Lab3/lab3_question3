3.)
a.) Replicate the example from the video and take a screenshot of wireshark showing a flow modification message.

//done, just add screenshot/s of flow mod message

b.) Show the flow table on switch s1. (Hint: Remember how from the walkthrough.) There are separate entries for flows from h1 and from h4. Why is there not a single bi-directional flow table entry instead.


c.) After how long and under what conditions do the flow table entries at the switch expire?

According to Wireshark, the idle timeout is 60 seconds. So, after 60 seconds, a flow entry is deleted from the flow table and the hardware if no packets match the entry. Since the hard timeout is set to 0, it is not initialized and will not be used in this situation. 

d.) After the flow table entries have expired  run:
	Mininet> h1 ping -c5 h4
Why do the latencies tend to go down over time?

The latencies go down because the packets are being sent before any flow table entries are deleted. Since the destination of the packets matches entries in the flow table, the controller already knows where to send the packets by looking at the flow table. This allows it to send packets faster since it already knows where they go.
