a.) List three different protocols that appear in the protocol column in the unfiltered packet-listing window in Step 7.
	ARP, NTP, and DNS

b.) How long did it take from when the HTTP GET message was sent until the HTTP OK reply was received?
	0.055091 second

c.) What is the Internet address of the gaia.cs.umass.edu? What is the Internet address of your computer?
	gaia.cs.umass.edu IP address: 128.119.245.12
	My computer: 153.90.31.68

d.) Print the two HTTP messages (GET and OK) referred to in question 2 above. To do so, select Print from the Wireshark File command menu, and select the "Selected Packet Only" and "Print as displayed" radial buttons, and then click OK.
