Wireshark Intro:

a.) List three different protocols that appear in the protocol column in the unfiltered packet-listing window in Step 7.
	ARP, NTP, and DNS

b.) How long did it take from when the HTTP GET message was sent until the HTTP OK reply was received?
	6.190399 - 6.135045 = 0.055354 seconds

c.) What is the Internet address of the gaia.cs.umass.edu? What is the Internet address of your computer?
	gaia.cs.umass.edu IP address: 153.90.2.1
	My computer: 153.90.39.64

d.) Print the two HTTP messages (GET and OK) referred to in question 2 above. To do so, select Print from the Wireshark File command menu, and select the "Selected Packet Only" and "Print as displayed" radial buttons, and then click OK.
	Alright I have no idea what this step means, are we literally supposed to physically print it out? i'm so confused but whatevs
